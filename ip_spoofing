More about fail-safe and fail-secure:

TCP/IP is the tools for building a fail-safe communication system. When it is under attacks, 
part of it may be demage, but the rest can still function. It is like when there is a disaster, 
we check perform a detail check of the refugee when they are heading to a refugee camp.

Firewall is the tools we try to add to a portion of an fail-safe environment, and make that
sub-environment fail-security.

Who will benefit from a file-safe environment/system?

Who will benefit from a file-secure environment/system?

Where was the concept of firewall come from?
